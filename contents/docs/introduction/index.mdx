## Why Documents?

Documents was created as an open-source project to help the community streamline their documentation process, enabling developers to focus on more critical 
tasks. Built with scalability in mind, it adapts to projects of all sizes, from single-page guides to comprehensive knowledge bases. 

The integration of MDX, custom components and Tailwind CSS ensures an intuitive experience, simplifying both content creation and management. 

  - **Product Guides**: Comprehensive manuals for product usage, setup and troubleshooting.
  - **Business Documentation**: Clear and structured documentation for internal processes, policies and systems.
  - **Technical Manuals**: Detailed guides for APIs, software development kits (SDKs) and technical processes.

Documents offers extensive customization options, allowing you to easily align the design and functionality with your branding.

You'll find the documentation's navigation bar on the left side of the screen. The pages are organized in a logical sequence, progressing from foundational 
topics to more advanced concepts, allowing you to follow along step-by-step as you build your documentation. However, feel free to explore the content in 
any order, selecting the sections most relevant to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, a table of contents provides easy navigation between sections of each page. For quick access to specific content, you can 
use the search bar at the top or the search shortcut (`Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`).
